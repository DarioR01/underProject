       "' days after the women’s march on washington the trump administration and republicans in congress launched attacks on public funding for women’s health care on monday president trump reinstated the global gag rule which strips all us funding from foreign aid groups that counsel patients on abortion rather than decrease abortion rates the move is likely to increase them devastate the global health system in the process and leave millions of women across the globe without access to either safe abortion or contraception and on tuesday afternoon house republicans voted to permanently ban us women too from receiving any federal financial assistance for abortion whether they are insured through public programs like medicaid or if they purchase private health insurance on the affordable care act exchanges the bill would codify existing restrictions that make abortion harder for poor women to get the text of the bill hr 7 introduced by rep christopher smith ( ) states that its purpose is to “prohibit abortions ” but federal tax dollars are already not allowed to pay for abortion either in the us or overseas the hyde amendment currently bans federal funding for abortion in the us it makes exceptions for women who become pregnant through rape or incest or whose lives would be endangered by the pregnancy but not for women who have any other maternal health issues or fetal abnormalities the hyde amendment is a budget rider that has passed every year since 1976 not a permanent law congress always technically has the option to pass a budget without hyde but it’s never actually done so in the 40 years since hyde was first introduced republicans in congress want to take that option away passing hr 7 would codify the language of the hyde amendment into permanent law (passing the law through the senate would require 60 votes to break a democratic filibuster which would be possible but seems unlikely) pushing to make hyde permanent is “doubling down on harmful policy and disregarding the health of women and other women who receive health insurance coverage and care through the federal government” said megan donovan senior policy manager at the guttmacher institute as it turns out a lot of people get their health insurance through the federal government federal employees military service members incarcerated people native americans who use indian health service facilities and people who are insured through medicaid the medicaid ban in particular means that abortion is already disproportionately unaffordable for poor women young women and women of color all of whom are more likely to need abortions in the first place about one in six women of reproductive age rely on medicaid for their health insurance currently 17 states have a policy to use their own state medicaid funds to pay for abortion services but 60 percent of women on medicaid don’t live in those states so they can’t get any insurance coverage for abortion at all more than half of those women who can’t get any coverage are women of color the bill could also effectively eliminate private insurance coverage of abortion if hr 7 were passed into law it could “effectively ban” private insurers from covering abortion through plans on the affordable care act exchanges jamila taylor a senior fellow in women’s health at the center for american progress told vox to be clear hr 7 doesn’t ban abortion coverage directly instead it gives insurers almost no other choice but to stop offering plans on the aca exchanges that cover abortion under hr 7 women who buy an insurance plan that covers abortion through the aca exchanges won’t be able to receive government subsidies and without those subsidies buying insurance through the affordable care act is a lot less affordable if insurance that covers abortion is much more expensive than insurance that doesn’t most people will choose the cheaper option that wouldn’t leave insurance companies much incentive to offer abortion coverage at all even if it’s technically not prohibited by law about half of all us states already restrict abortion coverage on their aca exchanges hr 7 would extend similar restrictions to the other half of the country “it’s clear the goal is to try to eliminate private coverage of abortion entirely” donovan said despite these impacts private insurance coverage isn’t getting as much focus as the specter of “ abortions” in debate over the bill that may be because hr 7 isn’t a new bill the house has passed versions of it before when repealing the aca wasn’t a realistic possibility and gutting it through indirect means was a better approach now of course republicans in congress are actually pursuing a full aca repeal so from a rhetorical standpoint it’s less important for them to talk about the aca than it is to rally their base with talk of “ abortions” in advance of the march for life that’s coming up on friday grassroots advocates have been trying to overturn the hyde amendment for years and they’ve made significant headway passing hr 7 would make it a lot harder to get rid of the hyde amendment in the future and that would be a significant blow to the reproductive justice movement it’s hard to overstate the impact the hyde amendment has had on women’s access to abortion even compared with the slew of state restrictions on abortion that have passed in the last five years while some of those laws closed abortion clinics by the dozen the hyde amendment is even more sweeping: it has made abortion completely unaffordable for millions of women for 40 years somewhere along the line hyde became a point of consensus between and politicians a sort of third rail in abortion politics that neither side would touch it became status quo to consider abortion so controversial that at the very least there should be “no taxpayer funding” for it even lawmakers when fighting against efforts to defund planned parenthood may quickly point out that the organization can’t use tax dollars for abortion because hyde is “the law of the land ” in recent years however grassroots activists have been pushing hard to repeal hyde organizing efforts led by women of color have started to shift the conversation around hyde from being about tax dollars and shame to being about basic fairness and dignity that’s a big reason why the democratic party platform included a call to repeal the hyde amendment for the first time in 2016 and why a bill to repeal hyde was introduced in congress for the first time in 2015 polling also suggests that most americans would be just fine with repealing hyde a survey conducted by hart research for all above all the grassroots coalition pushing to repeal hyde is striking large majorities of voters even republicans in battleground states agree with the statement “however we feel about abortion politicians should not be allowed to deny a woman’s health coverage for it just because she’s poor ” black voters are by far the most supportive of this sentiment and a majority of those polled 54 percent say they would support a law requiring medicaid to cover abortions the hyde amendment leaves many poor women with no “choice” at all the hyde amendment makes it incredibly difficult if not impossible for a woman to actually exercise her right to an abortion hyde means that women on medicaid have to pay a median cost of $575 for an abortion which is about a third of monthly income for most of these women “of the women who report that medicaid isn’t paying for their abortion most are already or ” said sarah roberts a public health social scientist at advancing new standards in reproductive health (ansirh) “they skip meals or they’re unable to pay their rent or mortgage ” “women will go to great lengths to get an abortion” said diane an abortion provider and an advocacy fellow with physicians for reproductive health “but you can’t get blood from a stone if somebody doesn’t have the money they don’t have the money ” that’s why many advocates see the hyde amendment as “discrimination pure and simple” said “it’s discrimination against women who are poor against people who are already struggling to survive and make ends meet ” the human costs of banning public abortion funding can be devastating provides abortions in both maryland where medicaid can cover abortions and the district of columbia where it can’t the difference between the two she says is “night and day ” “a lot of people don’t even know” she said “they’re shocked they’re floored to find out that medicaid doesn’t cover abortion because it covers everything else and their friends in maryland can use their medicaid they’re blown away ” sometimes women delay the procedure in order to have enough time to scrape the money together but if they delay long enough they might need to have a more expensive and riskier procedure “from a purely public health perspective it makes sense to help women get the abortion as early as possible” said dan grossman director of ansirh “funding restrictions can end up having a negative health impact ” and women who become pregnant by an abusive partner and can’t get an abortion will often find themselves even further trapped in the cycle of abuse so it’s no wonder that not being able to afford the procedure might drive some women to desperation including trying to give themselves an abortion at home when researchers interview women who have tried to an abortion many of them mention cost as a reason for doing so women who become pregnant by an abusive partner and can’t get an abortion will often find themselves even further trapped in the cycle of abuse that’s why shortly after the hyde amendment passed grassroots abortion rights advocates started creating abortion funds organizations that raise funds give rides watch children (60 percent of women who have abortions are already mothers) and provide other services for women who need abortions but can’t afford them today 70 of these groups in 38 states are organized under the banner of the national network of abortion funds (nnaf) but abortion funds while they provide a lifeline for many women in need can’t come close to filling the funding gap nnaf gets about 100 000 calls a year from women seeking financial assistance for an abortion executive director yamani hernandez said and can only fulfill about a third of those requests with an average grant of $200 per woman meanwhile there are 29 million women who are subject to hyde and other funding restrictions in america “thank goodness abortion access funds are there but they’ve got limited resources and they’re unable to help all the clients who call them” said “we shouldn’t have to crowdfund somebody’s medical care that shouldn’t be a thing ” women aren’t the only ones who suffer from hyde said she provides abortions in a hospital and several times a week she sees patients who have “devastating” prenatal diagnoses where the pregnancy is wanted but the fetus will likely not survive and where insurance won’t cover a termination because of the hyde amendment these tend to be later procedures which can cost $10 000 to $15 000 abortion funding organizations usually can’t cover expenses that high “we shouldn’t have to crowdfund somebody’s medical care” some of these patients are attorneys or analysts who have government jobs but because they are federal employees hyde affects them “these are people who have fantastic insurance or so they thought” said “and they come in and say ‘well what do you mean my insurance won’t cover this my baby will die are they saying i just have to continue the pregnancy and wait for that to happen’ and i have to say yeah that’s exactly what that means it feels heartless it feels uncaring “to put somebody through a doomed pregnancy when they don’t want to continue it and worry about the baby being born and experiencing pain it’s devastating for everybody involved and it makes you feel really angry at the people in the offices who are making these laws who don’t sit with these families and know what it feels like ” there are exceptions to the hyde amendment but they are extremely limited and don’t cover fetal anomalies they also don’t cover risks to a woman’s health that fall short of death and that puts doctors in a terrible position “how do you decide when someone is close enough to death to say that they deserve to have a pregnancy termination” said “from a clinician’s point of view there’s no ‘death checklist’ where we say well if you have this and this but not this then you’re not close enough you want to catch things before things get really bad and someone is at death’s door ” all of this the health impacts the economic impacts the social justice impacts is why activists have been pushing so hard to repeal hyde in just the three years since the all above all campaign went public repealing hyde has gone from a taboo subject to a mainstream position officially embraced by the democratic party it’s an issue that’s unlikely to go away quietly even under an administration and a republican congress watch: why birth control is so necessary

       "'dublin an assembly of irish citizens convened by parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country: the ban on abortions which has been enshrined in ireland’s constitution since 1983 the group a citizens’ assembly led by mary laffoy a supreme court judge does not have the power to change the law but its mandate from parliament to examine the full range of medical legal and ethical issues surrounding abortion suggests a willingness to revisit the ban one of the most stringent in the western world over the last three months the assembly has received more than 13 500 comments from the public more than 1 000 of which have been published online so far it pored over these submissions at the grand hotel malahide over the weekend along with testimony from experts and is scheduled to issue a report later this year abortion was already illegal in ireland before 1983 but the eighth amendment gave “the right to life of the unborn” equal status to “the right to life of the mother” under the constitution the amendment was enacted through a voter referendum and can be altered or abandoned only via another referendum several highly publicized cases since then have contributed to and reflected a shift in the public’s mood however in 2012 a woman savita halappanavar died from septic shock while having a miscarriage after a hospital denied her an abortion that might have saved her life and last year a united nations committee ruled that ireland had violated a woman’s rights by forcing her to travel abroad for an abortion even though severe congenital defects had been diagnosed in the fetus legal uncertainty over how to define “the unborn” has long dogged the amendment and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel’s criticisms it is common for women in ireland to travel to countries such as britain and the netherlands for abortions figures from britain’s national health service showed that more than 3 400 women gave irish addresses to british abortions clinics in 2015 that said ireland remains a conservative society and the roman catholic church opposes any change in the law “we believe that every unborn child irrespective of his or her medical condition or the circumstances of his or her birth has the right to be treated equally before the law” the bishops’ conference said in a statement submissions posted online expressed a wide range of views with many of them offering deeply personal perspectives leslie spillane a woman in her 20s from cork in southwestern ireland wrote that several of her friends had traveled abroad to terminate their pregnancies “these friends of mine are also the lucky ones they have been able to borrow the money for the travel and they have had friends they could tell” she wrote “abortions happen everyday making them illegal doesn’t stop woman needing or wanting them or inflicting them on themselves there will always be coat hangers broken bottles painkillers stairs to fall down fists to hit medicines to swallow ” in a phone interview she said that “even if you don’t agree with abortion it’s not morally acceptable to force your views onto others ” defenders of the law were equally adamant “abortion in our firm belief is the taking of human life irrespective of the stage of pregnancy” wrote kathleen gleeson and her husband raymond gleeson from county kerry in southwestern ireland valerie marjoram a woman in her 30s in county kildare just west of dublin described herself as a feminist who opposed abortion on religious grounds “i find it appalling that a certain brand of feminism would put more effort into obtaining the legal sanction of murdering one’s own child than fighting for the right to carry a child to term without losing one’s pay career path promotion college place” she said in a phone interview “the fact that abortion is legal in any country has led to a culture of selfishness where even life can be rescheduled if it happens at the ‘wrong time ’” the eighth amendment has been subject to legal and political challenges over the years in 1992 ireland’s highest court upheld the right to an abortion if the mother’s life is at risk including from suicide but how to interpret that right remains in dispute in 1992 voters approved an amendment to the constitution to allow women to travel abroad for abortions and to receive information about abortion services abroad and in that year and again in 2002 voters rejected amendments that would have removed the threat of suicide as grounds for a legal abortion conor o’mahony a lecturer in law at university college cork says the continued contentiousness reveals problems with the wording of the ban “the eighth amendment doesn’t work as a means of regulating abortion whether you are coming from the or abortion rights perspective” he said in a phone interview “and the evidence i would give you is that neither side has ever been happy with how that amendment has been interpreted and applied over the years ” he said that public opinion had been gradually shifting in favor of legalizing abortion particularly in cases involving severe fetal abnormalities or rape but predicted that the debate would continue for years even if a referendum was to take place in the near future gerard whyte a professor of law at trinity college dublin said in a phone interview that it would be unwise to simply repeal the amendment as some advocates seek “if there is no constitutional protection for the unborn then there is a problem and we’re into uncharted territory” he said “i’m simply warning about a situation whereby people decide to repeal the eighth but don’t add anything else ”'"
